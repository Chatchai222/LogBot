Hello this is me currently
I currently like speedrunning my projects
cause my addiction is calling to play more divinity 2 and factorio
but I can't really do anythign about it so...
I trying to speedrun my learning so I can spend less time on them but still complete 
it nicely enough that it won't cause a problem. I just had coffee too
so it certainly turned me into a crazed jittery mess who want to speedrun this 
alright but
ye gonna keep going to do my project and important stuff I guess?
